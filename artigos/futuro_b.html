        <p><span class="Abstract">Abstract: </span> The evaluation of sheep feed intake (FI) in feed efficiency
            tests is a trait of difficult measurement, associated with the high cost of labor, feeding, and facilities.
            Decreasing the test period and applying machine learning approaches, considering traits as potential
            predictors, could optimize the resources and provide a greater number of animals with feed intake
            information, reducing the cost of evaluating by animal and allowing to test a greater number per year. For
            this reason, the objectives of this thesis were to explore residual feed intake (RFI) models to decrease the
            test duration and to test four approaches to find the best feed intake prediction method. Two research were
            carried out with the test period consisting of 56 days. In the first paper, the data was collected from 286
            Australian Merino sheep of three performed trials. Two models were used to calculate RFI, Model 1 (linear
            model) and Model 2 (weekly model or repeatability model by week). Model 1 included average daily gain (ADG)
            estimates by linear regression and average FI of the period. The model 2 included weekly average FI as a
            repeated measure and the weekly ADG. The second study comes from 613 Australian Merino, 156 Corriedale, and
            237 Dohne Merino sheep of ten feed intake trials. To train the models, 477, 70 and 93 observations of Merino
            Australian, Corriedale and Merino Dohne sheep were used, respectively. And direct validation was performed
            on 97 Australian Merino, 79 Corriedale and 125 Merino datasets. The prediction models were linear
            regression, nonlinear regression, k-nearest neighbors regression, and random forest regression. In the first
            study, the Pearson and Spearman correlations between linear and repeated models with 42-days for ADG were
            0.89 and 0.87, respectively. The best correlations were detected for FI between 42 and 35-days models,
            presenting Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.95 and 0.94 in the linear model, and 0.96 and 0.95 in the
            weekly model. When considering RFI, the correlations between linear and weekly 42-days models were from 0.93
            and 0.92, respectively. The 35-days RFI length models (linear and weekly) presented Pearson and Spearman
            correlations greater than 0.98 with the 42-days models. Therefore, the RFI models 35-days of duration
            allowed to decrease seven days of the FI test while maintaining accuracy and explaining 75.3% of the FI in
            the linear model and 63.6% of the weekly model. In the second study, the highest R2 was found in the
            nonlinear model with a value of 0.76 in the cross-validation of the training data set, with Pearson and
            Spearman correlation, respectively, of 0.87 and 0.85. In direct validation on the Australian Merino,
            Corriedale and Dohne Merino datasets, Pearson's correlation from 0.69 to 0.86 and Spearman's correlation
            from 0.63 to 0.86 were found. Reducing seven days of testing and use approaches for FI prediction would
            provide a greater data collection into a year of phenotypic evaluation.
